# Blackjack

https://youtu.be/SngIHvvYaFI

This is Blackjack, written in C++. Includes:
-User accounts (Includes tally of winnings and player rankings)
-Leaderboard
-Basic dealer AI / Level of difficulty 
-Lots of other stuff that I will add

NOTE:
THIS IS A MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO PROJECT
You can look at the main code but if you download this and unzip you can actually
open it right up in VS and compile immediately.

--I still need to come back and make it more OO
